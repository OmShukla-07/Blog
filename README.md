# Django Blog Application

A simple, extensible Blog platform built with Django 5 that supports user authentication, post management, and a clean separation of concerns for future feature expansion.

> Collaboration Welcome: If you’d like to collaborate, suggest improvements, raise issues, report bugs, or propose new features—your contributions are most welcome. Open an Issue or a Pull Request anytime.
>
> Backend for Practice: This repository currently represents a fully functional backend. You are free to plug in your own custom frontend (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, Angular, etc.) and use this as a learning playground or starter backend. Treat it as an open practice server for experimenting with UI/UX ideas.

## 🚀 Deployment (Generic Gunicorn + WhiteNoise)

Example Procfile (if using a platform that reads it):
```
web: gunicorn django_project.wsgi --log-file -
```

Typical production steps (conceptually):
1. Install dependencies
2. Run migrations
3. (If needed) collect static files
4. Start Gunicorn process

---

## 🧪 Running Tests (if/when added)

```bash
python manage.py test
```

Place tests inside each app: `app_name/tests/`
